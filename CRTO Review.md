# What is CRTO?
CRTO is supposed to be an introductory course into red teaming tradecraft, from initial compromise all the way to domain takeover and data exfiltration. From their website:

````
""**Red Team Ops** is an online course that teaches the basic principals, tools and techniques, that are synonymous with red teaming.

Students will first cover the core concepts of adversary simulation, command & control, and how to plan for an engagement. They will then learn about each stage of the attack lifecycle from initial compromise, to full domain takeover, data hunting, and exfiltration. Students will also take various OPSEC concerns into account and learn how to bypass defences such as Windows Defender, AMSI and AppLocker. Finally, they will cover reporting and post-engagement activities."
